        <h2>Shipping Policy</h2>

        <h3>Processing Time</h3>
        <p>
            All orders are processed within <strong>1–3 working days</strong> (Monday–Friday, excluding UK bank holidays).
            During busy periods (sales, launches, holidays), processing times may be slightly longer.
            If there are delays, we’ll notify you by email.
        </p>

        <h3>Shipping Locations</h3>
        <p>
            We currently ship <strong>within the United Kingdom only</strong>.
            We’re working on adding international shipping in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>Delivery Times (UK)</h3>
        <p>
            Standard delivery usually takes <strong>3–5 working days</strong> after dispatch.
            Delivery times are estimates only. Once your order has been handed to the courier,
            delays caused by the courier or Royal Mail are outside our control.
        </p>

        <h3>Shipping Fees</h3>
        <p>
            Shipping costs are shown at checkout before you confirm payment.
            Any promotional or free-shipping offers will be clearly displayed on our website or social media.
        </p>

        <h3>Order Confirmation &amp; Tracking</h3>
        <p>
            After placing an order, you’ll receive an <strong>order confirmation email</strong>.
            Once your order is dispatched, you’ll receive a <strong>shipping confirmation email</strong>,
            which may include a tracking number or delivery reference (where available).
        </p>

        <h3>Wrong Address / Missed Delivery</h3>
        <p>

            address provided by the customer. If a parcel is returned to us due to an incorrect or incomplete address or
            missed delivery, we can resend it once additional postage has been paid.
        </p>
